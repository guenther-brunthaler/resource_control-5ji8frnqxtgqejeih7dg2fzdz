This is a description of DCM revision 1.1 (for which the design phase started 2020-04-25).


Abstract
--------

The Descriptor Component Model (DCM) is a model for exposing and using objects between different software components.

It is typically being used by external "plug-in"- or "functionality extension"-modules in order to communicate with the main application executable.

The purpose of DCM is communication between compilation units built at different times, often by different developers and on different machines.

DCM is an alternative to existing software component models like DCOM and XPCOM.

Compared to those models, DCM is less restrictive, more generic, easier to implement, and does not require type casts or the use of C preprocessor macros.


Long description
----------------

At the basic level, DCM is employed by processes running in the same address space on the same machine. This applies to most typical plug-in modules.

But by employing any kind of IPC (inter-process communication) or RPC (remote procedure call), this can be also be extended to different address spaces on the same machine, to different nodes within a computing cluster, or to communication between arbitrary networked remote computers. 


Descriptors
~~~~~~~~~~~

The heart of DCM is the 'descriptor'. This is also what gives the model its name.

A descriptor is a 'C/C++'-language `struct` (or simple variable if this is sufficient) fully exposed to its users which should contain at least a pointer to a method table.

By convention, this pointer has the field name '`m`' (like "methods") within the descriptor structure and will also be its first field.

But even though recommended, this is not required. Any name will do, and it does not need to be the first field either. (Neither does it need to exist. But as a class without methods is not good for much, most classes will provide a method table.)

The descriptor is *not* supposed to contain any private data used by an object. Such data (typically class-private data or instance variables of an object) will be stored elsewhere, as will be explained later.

The method table contains function pointers to all methods provided by one particular class of the software component.

Note that while every software component might provide several such classes, an object descriptor can only refer to one of those classes at the same time. (At least usually. It is not forbidden that a descriptor may describe multiple classes at the same time, containing multiple method table pointers.)

Normally, method tables should be constant and contain only function pointers. However, this is not mandatory either. The method table can contain data fields as well, even writable data. However, it is strongly advised against doing such things without very good reason.

DCM descriptors can describe both classes and objects.


A minimal class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A minimal DCM descriptor will typically look like this:

[listing]
--
include::dcm_demo_1.h[]
--

Of course, such a descriptor would be quite useless because it does not describe anything. It is not even a `struct` because it contains no components. But it is nevertheless a valid DCM class descriptor.

We also need a way to create an instance of such a descriptor. Here is a possible implementation:

[listing]
--
include::dcm_demo_1_impl.c[]
--

And here is how to use the factory function:

[listing]
--
include::dcm_demo_1_main.c[]
--

As useless at it may be, this factory function demonstrates another important convention used by typical DCM factory and interface navigation functions: They pass not only the pointer to the descriptor structure which shall be initialized, but also its byte size.

This is a simple protection of the caller against changes made to the descriptor structure since the application was compiled.

Without this check, it would be possible that the factory function (living in a different compilation unit) initializes more fields than the caller provided in its outdated definition of the descriptor structure, leading to memory corruption.

Even though checks like this are not mandatory for DCM factory functions, but they are highly recommended.


The next-best minimal class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will now enhance the minimal class from the previous section and add a method table pointer to it.

However, there will still be no methods provided. (Otherwise it could not be a minimal class any more.)

[listing]
--
include::dcm_demo_2.h[]
--

Note that there is no definition for `struct miniclass2_methods`. This is not required because this class does not provide any methods, and thus the `m` pointer needs never to be dereferenced.

This makes `struct miniclass2_methods` an incomplete class, but this is allowed in 'C' as long as no-one actually tries to access the fields of such a class.

[listing]
--
include::dcm_demo_2_impl.c[]
--

[listing]
--
include::dcm_demo_2_main.c[]
--

As one can see, usage and even the factory function are functionally identical to the previous versions of those files. This should not be a surprise though, because it is still quite a useless class.


A minimalistic class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Obviously, a minimal class as described in the previous sections is not good for anything, except perhaps serving as some kind of dummy object.

Therefore, this section will show the implementation of a minimalistic class that does something (more or less) useful.

It provides a single method `answer` which returns the number `42`:

[listing]
--
include::dcm_demo_3.h[]
--

This time, there is a method table, even though it contains only a single method function.

[listing]
--
include::dcm_demo_3_impl.c[]
--

[listing]
--
include::dcm_demo_3_main.c[]
--

This example program will output nothing if the `answer`-method works as expected, and will otherwise terminate with some kind of error message.

There are two important things the `main()` function does in this case:

* Call a factory function for populating the descriptor

* Call a method via the descriptor's method table found via the `m` pointer.
